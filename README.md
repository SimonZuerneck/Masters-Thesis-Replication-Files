Replication files for my Master's thesis:  
**"Migration and Uncertainty â€“ The Effect of the Brexit Referendum on Work-Related Migration from the EU to the UK"**

## Instructions

1. **Always run the `master.do` file first**  
2. **Adjust file paths**  
3. **Install the required ado.files mentioned in the master file.**  
4. **Data access**  
   The datasets used in this thesis are publicly available. Links to the data sources are provided in the main thesis document.

## Notes on Graph Output

The ado-files for the `sdid` and `sdid_event` commands by Clarke et al. (2024) and Ciccia (2024) have been **modified** by me to adjust the appearance of the output graphs.  
**The code for computing the SDiD estimates has not been altered.**  
Nonetheless, this means that the design of the graphs in the replication output differs from the figures in the main thesis document. 

## Declaration of Originality

All code in this repository was written by me.  
I had access to the replication files from the related study:

> *"Expecting Brexit and UK Migration: Should I Go?"*  
> Di Iasio & Wahba (2023)
